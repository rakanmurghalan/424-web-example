Learning example repository for ISOM 424 students

## Introduction
This project enables us to learn source code control using Git.

##Purpose
To have code we can use for hands on exercises. We are also using this to see how rebasing and merging works.

##Conflict on ConflictBranch 
This section will be different on the conflictbranch as soon as we save, close, add, and commit it.

##Method
How will we resolve this conflict, since the "base" now has a conflict in it?
